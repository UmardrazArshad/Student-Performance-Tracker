# Student Performance Tracker project
## Project Structure
- First we create **Student class** that takes student names scores and calculate average of the student and also chek the passing status.
- The we create a **PerformanceTracker** class that that add students and calculate average through methods.
- Then we create the **main function** that get the information from the user and then then store it into the methods and perform calculations and overall
  perfromance by calling methods. And i also use **try except** blocks to keep my code error free and user will get friendly message instead of error.
- Then we **display** the each students performance.
